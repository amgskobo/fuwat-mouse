Welcome to the **fuwat_mouse** repository!

## Project Summary

This project documents the development of a compact, handheld wireless trackball device ("air mouse") using the ultra-small AZ1UBALL trackball and Seeed Studio's Xiao BLE (nRF52840) microcontroller. The device is designed for single-handed operation, featuring a body just 70mm long and 22mm wide—small enough to fit comfortably in your palm.

- **One-handed operation:** Enables left/right mouse clicks, cursor movement, scrolling, D-pad actions, and volume control.
- **10 physical buttons:** Allows diverse input and control.
- **Multi-layer support via ZMK firmware:** Switch between mouse control, shortcuts, and device selection, all on one device.
- **Live customization:** Modify keymaps and layers in real-time using ZMK Studio.
- **Highly compact:** All features packed into a tiny enclosure.
